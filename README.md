# Apiary Base Styles
Stylus mixin and variable library to make developing Apiary UI easier.

## Usage

```bash
npm i apiary-base-styles -S
```

and in your Stylus

```stylus
@import 'apiary-base-styles'
```

This will include main `.styl` file and you can start using mixins and variables. See [Apiary Base Styles](https://styles.apiary-services.com) for live examples.

## Goals

- Unify fonts, colors and common elements
- Unopinionated and flexible
- 0 kb dependency - _only expose mixins_ and allows gradual rollout

## Developing

```bash
npm start
```

Will start a [Hexo](https://hexo.io) server on port `4000`.
